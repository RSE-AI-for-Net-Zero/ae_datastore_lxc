Unit

File format:
format with script to read it.

Facility
--------
(which wind tunnel)


Model - e.g. truck
------------------
(describe the model)
Name, id, description, drawing, 
Characteristic dimension: (W, D, L)
Image
(? where in tree?) Location of model in wind tunnel
Define origin for model configuration
Reference systems - e.g., truck vs. wind tunnel
Reference orientation (yaw, pitch roll)
Location of measurements

Experimental configuration
--------------------------
Measurements:
- what?
- device name, model, manufacturer
- extra_info - (description, filename)
             - (description, DOI)
	     - (... , URL)



(pressure)
- sampling frequency
- acquisition time
- location(s) of measurements
- number of measurements

(velocity)
- technique (recognised in the field, very standardised)
determines what data are
    - PIV / PTV (determine what plane 
         - planar / stereo / tomo (or shake the box)
	 - acquisition frequency
	 - resolution - number of nodes in t,x,y,z
    - HW
         - single
	 - cross
	 
    - LDA
         - 1, 2 or 3d (1d rare)
    - Pitot probe (not used so much)
    -  other techniques to be added later
    
    - 2D or 3D

HW and LDA sensors can be moved around between runs
Force - global measurement, therefore nearer top of tree

(force)
- device (useful for determining uncertainty) -> location in model description
- location(s) of device
- sampling frequency and acquisition time
- .... associated with file containing (t, x, y, z, px, py, pz)

Specific - in file

Can change model / wt configuration

Characteristic dimension
U\inf (free stream velocity):
- number
- downstream location of pitot (x,y,z)

R_e (Reynolds number)

There are some cases of several Reynolds numbers - extensible (add more options)

Suction - primary and secondary, expressed in terms of voltage (to remove the boundary layer)
Rolling road - on off - in theory at same speed as free stream

Model location

Yaw, pitch and roll
-------------------
